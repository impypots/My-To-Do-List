# My To Do List
 Making a to do list for practice :)

 12/14 Breaking my head trying to get JS code to add an HTML paragraph element without immediately removing it. Effectively added nothing, but hey here's a commit.

 12/15 Made a lot more progress today. App now gives each paragraph element a random color, clicking an element crosses through it, and clicking it again causes it to fade away, either to the left or the right. Oh yeah, and it actually works.
